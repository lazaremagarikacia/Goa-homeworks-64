<p>Welcome to this site where you will learn about programming languages</p>
<h1>Programming language</h1>
<p>A programming language is a formal system of symbols used to create programs. A programming language has lexical , semantic, and syntactic rules.

    There are currently over 2,000 programming languages, and their number is growing every year. Some languages ​​are popular, while others are used only by authors. It is even possible to use several programming languages ​​simultaneously to create professional programs.
    
    The great variety of programming languages ​​makes it impossible to classify them according to any single scale. There is no best programming language, just as there is no best spoken language. The choice of a programming language should be determined by its intended use.</p>
    <h2>Python</h2>   
    <p>Python is a high-level, dynamic programming language with a wide range of capabilities, designed to make code easy to read. Python 's standard library is large and comprehensive. It uses very few block separators - paragraphs.

        Python is a multi-paradigm language that incorporates elements of procedural, imperative, and functional programming. It is often compared to languages ​​such as Tcl, Perl , Ruby , Scheme , and Java . Some of Python's features include:
        
        Extremely clear, understandable, and readable syntax
        Introspection
        Multi-paradigm design with an object-oriented approach
        Full modularity
        Extremely high-level data typing
        Metaprogramming
        Extensive standard library
        The Python interpreter is a virtual machine, so this language is multiplatform and programs written in Python can be run on virtually all platforms. When we type python somescript.py in the console , the interpreter performs the following operations:
        
        Checks if somescript.pyc (byte-compiled code) or somescript.pyo (optimized code) exists in the same directory
        If the byte-compiled code does not exist, the interpreter dynamically creates it and runs the program.
        If byte-compiled code exists, the interpreter compares the source (somescript.py) and this byte-code (somescript.pyc) during modification.
        If the source is newer, i.e. it was edited after compilation, the interpreter deletes the existing bytecode and creates it anew.
        The interpreter virtual machine executes the bytecode.
        The speed of Python programs is absolutely comparable to the speed of programs written in Java. Like Java, Python has so-called JIT-compilers. Of these, the most often cited is psyco, a JIT-compiler for Intel-compatible processors. Another factor that contributes to the performance of programs written in Python is the clear and understandable Python/C API. Moreover, the Python standard library includes ctypes, Archived 2006-11-09 at the Wayback Machine . Through which it is possible to call any function from a dll/so written in C.
        
        Memory management is done automatically, via the so-called garbage collector, however, Python classes have a destructor that can be called at any time. Like other modern programming languages, error handling is done programmatically using a try-except-else-finally block.
        
        Callability of objects is one of the main concepts of Python. A callable object in Python is similar to a functor in C++. The difference is that any function, even if it is given outside the scope of a class, in a module, is not a simple procedure, but a callable object. Like all other objects, they have their own attributes, the use of which is often advisable. For example, 'func_closure', 'func_code', 'func_defaults', 'func_dict', 'func_doc', 'func_globals', 'func_name'... This is precisely what determines the ability and simplicity of dynamic introspection (in Java - reflection). Of course, operator overloading is possible in Python. It is also worth noting that a Python module is an ordinary object that can be created dynamically at any time. Python has both static and class methods. Thus, when functions are mentioned in Python, they always refer to callable objects. The latter can also be called co-routines Archived 2006-11-09 at the Wayback Machine . , which means that they can be used as generators.
        
        Web programming has long been one of the areas where Python has been used, with examples from Google™. Python's recent success has been linked to the adoption of the so-called Python Web Server Gateway Interface (wsgi) . Particularly high-performance frameworks are

        Django
        TurboGears
        Each of them has its own preferred use case, and each of them is WSGI-compatible, so a web application written on one platform can in principle be used on another. Production deployment of Python web applications is done on mod_python, fastcgi, scgi , and twistd platforms. Their WSGI-compatibility is ensured by flup .
        
        Communication with databases is carried out both with the help of direct adapters and with the help of object-relational mappings (ORM). sqlalchemy is the most powerful and popular library for the latter. Python also successfully uses object-oriented databases, see e.g. ZODB Archived 2006-04-25 at the Wayback Machine . .
        
        Network programming is a favorite area of ​​use for Python, as exemplified by the network programming platform twistd , an asynchronous variant, and cherrypy Archived 2021-05-14 at the Wayback Machine . — a multiprocess (thread-based) library.
        
        Pythonics  — the only correct style of programming in Python, an integral part of Python as a language per se . There is one and only one right way to do it, — as they jokingly say, is the main mantra of Python Zen. In practice, the presence of such a style results in significant savings of resources and time when designing a project.
        
        Clones , or versions of Python, exist for both Java and the CLR. The first is Jython and the second is IronPython .
        
        Special efficiency in programming in Python is achieved by using techniques such as meta-programming, method decoration, lambda operator, contracts, generic functions, etc.
        
        setuptools & easy_install are the preferred method for distributing and obtaining software products written in Python.</p>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript ( / ˈ dʒ ɑː v ɑː ˌ s k r ɪ p t / ; pronounced: जावसक्रिप्टि ; abbreviation JS /ˈdʒeɪ.ɛs./ ) is a widely used programming language. The name JavaScript is a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc.

    History
    JavaScript was created by Netscape , and was first included in the Netscape Navigator browser. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript. It was introduced as part of Netscape Navigator version 2.0B3 in December 1995. JavaScript appeared in Internet Explorer in 1996 , with the official release of Internet Explorer 3.0.</p>
<h4>CSS</h4>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language , such as HTML . [ 1 ] CSS  is a technological cornerstone of the web , along with HTML and JavaScript . [ 2 ] CSS is designed to separate content from its presentation, including colors, fonts, and layout. [ 3 ] Such separation can improve content accessibility, provide greater flexibility and manageability in defining presentation properties, enable multiple web pages to use shared formatting by describing the relevant styles in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the content structure, as well as provide caching of the .css file , which increases the loading speed of different pages with shared styles and formatting.

    The separation of formatting and content also allows the same page to be presented in different styles for different delivery methods, such as for display, print, audio, and Braille- based tactile devices. CSS allows formatting to change when the content is accessed from a mobile device. [ 4 ] The name "cascading" comes from the style precedence scheme that determines which style will be applied to an element when more than one rule is defined for the same element. The cascading precedence scheme is predictable.
    
    The technical specifications for Cascading Style Sheets are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The Internet Media Type (MIME type) text/cssis registered for use with Cascading Style Sheets in RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C provides a free service for validating CSS documents.
    
    In addition to HTML, the use of CSS is supported in other markup languages, including XHTML , XML , SVG , and XUL .
    
    Syntax
    CSS has a simple syntax and uses a limited number of English keywords to define the names of various style properties. A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or set of rules consists of one or more selectors and a declaration block . The selector is placed on the left side of the rule before the <? {> sign, and the declaration block is placed on the right side of the rule and is enclosed in curly braces. A declaration block can contain one or more declarations, separated by semicolons ;. The components of a declaration are a property and its value ; a colon is placed between the property and its value :.</p>
